aircraft with solar cell.\",\n          \"The utility model discloses an environment-friendly illumination lamp, which relates to the technical field of illumination lamps and comprises the following components: a lamp post; the lighting lamp is positioned at one end of the lamp post and used for lighting a road; a power assembly positioned in the lamp column for providing power to the illumination lamp; the greening assembly is positioned on the outer side of the lamp post and used for placing greening vegetation; the watering assembly is positioned on the lamp post and used for adding moisture to vegetation on the greening assembly; the water storage component is positioned on the side surface of the lamp post and used for collecting and filtering rainwater and providing a water source for the watering component; the power assembly can convert solar energy and wind energy into electric energy, so that the illuminating lamp is convenient to use; afforestation subassembly is equipped with multiunit and evenly distributed in the lamp pole side, conveniently improves the afforestation area, and the retaining subassembly can be collected the rainwater and filter, sprays the afforestation subassembly through the subassembly that waters on with the rainwater, and the vegetation on the afforestation subassembly is conveniently watered, makes things convenient for the vegetation to grow, facilitates the use.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"inventors\",\n      \"properties\":

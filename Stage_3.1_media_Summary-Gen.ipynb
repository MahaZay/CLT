In the face of widespread opposition to the plan and his own plummeting popularity, Suga said on Feb. 9 that a decision would be made \\u201c at an appropriate time. \\u201d The delay reflects a combination of political unease over announcing definitive plans to dump the water into the Pacific, which has long been the government's preferred route. Pressure for an immediate decision has also slightly eased thanks to reduced inflow of groundwater and rainwater into the contaminated site. This has pushed out -- although only by a few months -- the 2022 date by when Tokyo Electric Power Co. Holdings ( Tepco) says it will run out of tank capacity to store the treated water, which despite treatment still contains tritium. However, a decision is reportedly needed roughly two years in advance of any release to give Tepco time to decide on specific methods, secure approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, carry out preparatory work and begin the disposal process. As of Jan. 21, Tepco reported a total of 1.24 million cubic meters of treated water in storage versus total tank capacity of 1.37 million cubic meters. In 2020 Tepco projected that its tank storage capacity would be filled in the summer of 2022, but Fukushima Daiichi Decontamination & Decommissioning Engineering Co. President Akira Ono reportedly told a Jan. 28 news conference that the estimate will be adjusted to autumn of the same year as contaminated water volumes at the plant were now averaging 140 metric tons per day versus a 150 metric ton/d target. A Tepco spokesperson told Energy Intelligence Feb. 12 that relatively lower amounts of heavy rainfall in typhoons last fall helped ease pressure, but confirmed that `` it is still necessary to systematically construct necessary facilities, \\u201d such as more tanks, and \\u201c effectively use the entire site. '' `` They have been working very hard to successfully reduce the inflow of groundwater and rainwater that enter the building basements, becoming contaminated, requiring processing, and eventual additional tank storage, '' Lake Barrett, a senior adviser to Tepco, told Energy Intelligence. He added that this is a relatively dry season so short-term numbers may be misleading but that the `` trend is solidly downward and they are continuing actions to even further reduce in-leakage. '' This is giving `` the government more flexibility to find the least bad time to decide something, '' but a decision on water disposition, will be needed to allow more room for storing additional treated water, said Barrett. `` This can not go on forever. '' Difficult Timing After Suga, newly installed as prime minister, said last September that a decision would be made \\u201c as soon as possible \\u201d local media widely reported that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ( Meti) would make a basic policy decision on Oct. 27 in favor of the `` ocean release '' plan of water. But that date passed without action in the wake of an Oct. 8 face-off between Meti officials and leaders of the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations ( Zengyoren), who declared \\u201c absolute opposition \\u201d to the ocean release option, leading the Suga administration to back off ( NIW Oct.16'20). On Feb 4, Meti Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama, responding to questions by lawmakers in a budget committee hearing of the lower house, reportedly said a decision would be made \\u201c at some time \\u201d and that more \\u201c dialogue \\u201d with fisheries cooperatives was needed. It remains to be seen whether Diet lawmakers begin to exercise more effective oversight of the government's water disposition plans. One item on their agenda is reviewing the Cabinet-level Reconstruction Agency's fiscal 2021 request for a big hike -- to 2 trillion yen ( $ 19.1 billion) -- from its original request of 500 billion yen to help constituencies ( fisheries) cope with reputational damage to domestic and export sales. In the meantime, public opinion continues to lean against the ocean release scheme and LDP opposition to the plan appears to be growing, with a recent survey showing that pro-LDP respondents opposed the plan by 47% to 41%. Even more seriously, Suga's political honeymoon is over amid a string of public relations disasters and criticism over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Having refrained from dissolving the House of Representatives last fall when his approval ratings were high, Suga and the LDP must face a reunited opposition led by the center-left CDP and its leader Yukio Edano in a general election before Oct. 22. The CDP leader, who was chief cabinet secretary at the time of the March 2011 disaster, has signaled his intent to make nuclear power an electoral issue and publicly described the tritium issue as \\u201c very serious '' ( NIW Aug.28'20). While it is unlikely that the conservative camp will lose control over the House of Representatives won by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe four years ago, Edano's success in rebuilding a credible opposition opens the possibility that the LDP-Komeito coalition is deprived of its razor-thin two-thirds majority or even the LDP's outright majority, thus opening the door to a more fluid political situation and the possibility of renewed debate over alternatives to ocean release such as long-term storage options allowing for further reduction of radioactivity from the tritium before release ( NIW Nov.22'19; NIW Oct.27'17). In the meantime, prospects for early resolution to the water disposition dilemma are uncertain at best. `` Given the failure of Meti to persuade fishery cooperatives to consent to this plan, the worsening of the Covid-19 situation and the progressive decline in his own popularity, it is very difficult for Suga to adopt the ocean dumping program at this time, '' observed Citizens ' Nuclear Information Center Secretary-General Hajime Matsukubo. The Tepco spokesperson told Energy Intelligence Feb. 12 that `` for the sake of reconstruction of Fukushima, we believe decommissioning and countermeasures to cope with contaminated water must be steadily completed and that it is necessary to complete the disposal of water treated by the multi-nuclide removal facility as part of the decommissioning work. '' While acknowledging that `` it is not for us to say when the government will provide a basic policy regarding the disposition of Alps [ Advanced Liquid Processing System ] treated water, '' the Tepco spokesperson said that `` we will take appropriate steps based on its decision. '' Dennis Engbarth, Taipei City\",\n          \"\\u2022 Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd. ( NPCIL) synchronized Kakrapar-3 in the western state of Gujarat to the grid on Jan. 10, making it the first of India's 700 megawatt indigenously developed pressurized heavy water reactors ( PHWRs) to reach this milestone ( NIW Sep.18'20). The news was tweeted by Anil Kakodkar, former chairman of the Department of Atomic Energy, who said that 15 more units of the same design will follow. Three of these are currently under construction -- another at Kakrapar, and two at NPCIL's Rajasthan plant. They will be followed by two at the greenfield Gorakhpur site in Haryana, and then a planned 10-unit fleet at Gorakhpur and three other sites. Kakrapar-3 was five years past its 2015 completion date, achieving criticality in July 2020, 10 years after construction began. Commercial operations are slated to begin in March, according to NPCIL's website, although that deadline will likely not be met. India's nuclear suppliers should be feeling some relief over Kakrapar-3's start-up, although order flows will depend on how quickly NPCIL can get other projects moving, and the course of the Covid-19 pandemic ( NIW Dec.11'20). \\u2022 The inaugural US small modular reactor ( SMR) project has moved into its second phase with Fluor and its NuScale subsidiary announcing Jan. 11 that per agreements with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems ( Uamps) they `` are to develop higher maturity cost estimates and initial project planning work for the licensing, manufacturing and construction of the CFPP [ Carbon Free Power Project ]. '' However, Uamps confirmed to Energy Intelligence that committed offtake now stands at just 100 MW for what was planned as a 750 MW, 12-module SMR plant. With NuScale providing additional options for `` plant size configuration, Uamps could decide to build a plant ranging from 4 modules ( 308 megawatts) to 12 modules ( 924 megawatts), '' a Uamps spokesman wrote in an email. In early 2019 Uamps boasted offtake commitments of 230 MW. But that included US Department of Energy ( DOE) plans to take output from up to two 60 MW modules. Those plans ended last year with the DOE instead offering $ 1.35 billion in multiyear funding for the project. Eight Uamps subscribers dropped out of the project and another two offtakers substantially reduced their commitments. \\u2022 Across the ocean NuScale has launched a play for the UK market via a memorandum of understanding with start-up clean energy firm Shearwater Energy to explore the deployment of hybrid SMR and wind energy projects across the country. The companies are hoping to score a flagship site at or near the Wylfa plant in north Wales, where last year Hitachi decided to wind down its advanced boiling water reactor ( ABWR) project development company ( NIW Sep.18'20). A Wylfa SMR-wind plant `` will provide 3 GW of reliable, zero-carbon electricity at a fraction of the cost of a conventional nuclear power station with surplus energy generation focused on the production of hydrogen to support the transport sector\\u2019 s transition to low-carbon fuels, '' Shearwater CEO Simon Forster said in a Jan. 12 statement. But Shearwater was only incorporated in 2018, and any way forward for the project is likely to depend on suitably attractive economics, a UK government nuclear subsidy regime, plus locking in a site that may be grabbed by another interested consortium first ( related).\",\n          \"Japan's Supreme Court will likely become the arbiter of a judicial schism over whether the government bears responsibility -- and therefore liability -- for the March 2011 accident at Fukushima Daichi. This possibility has become almost a certainty given that the division now exists at the appellate court level and that lawyers on both sides are gearing up for appeals to the country's highest court. At issue are two high court rulings in which judges relied on competing expert conclusions over the government's ability to predict, and prevent through regulation, the earthquake-tsunami that led to a station blackout and the subsequent triple meltdowns. In both cases, the judges ruled that the Tokyo Electric Power Co. ( Tepco), as plant operator, bore responsibility but in only one, at the Sendai High Court, did judges rule on Sep. 30 that the government also bore responsibility for compensating victims. Last week the Tokyo High Court, relying on a different tsunami assessment method, ruled that only Tepco bore responsibility ( NIW Jan.22'21). Considering the number of past and present cases involving either Fukushima compensation claims or reactor restarts it's clear that Japan's legal system continues to be a key factor in the future of Japan's nuclear energy program. There are about 30 class action proceedings nationwide by evacuees from the Fukushima accident, and the total number of plaintiffs is about 12,000. All 14 district court decisions to date have found Tepco liable for damages and have ordered the plant operator to award compensation, according to a tally by the Niigata Nippo daily. However, only seven of the 14 district court judgments found that under the State Compensation Act, which governs redress in cases of harm caused to citizens by the state or its officials, the national government also bore responsibility and required redress. The first of these was by the Maebashi District Court in Gunma prefecture, and its decision was overturned by last week's high court verdict. That decision set the tally of appellate court judgments on national government liability tied one-to-one, taking into account the Sendai High Court decision ( NIW Oct.9'20). The competing appellate court decisions pit two expert predictability assessments against each other. One by the government's own Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion, a Cabinet level office that uses analyses from government and academic seismologists, forecast in July 2002 a high probability -- 20% over the following 30 years and 30% over 50 years -- of an 8.2 magnitude earthquake in northeastern Japan that could generate tsunami as high as 15.7 meters. However, the Tokyo High Court cited as the basis for its judgment a book published in February 2002 by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers ( JSCE) which maintained its own \\u201c tsunami assessment method \\u201d to argue that the government forecasts did not \\u201c match \\u201d the JSCE's model and had uncertain predictive value. Moreover, in its judgment summary, the court stated that even if Tepco had installed a seawall of up to 15.7 meters the accident could not be prevented. However, as in other class action suits, the high court found that under the Act for Compensation for Nuclear Damage, which specifically addresses utility liability in nuclear cases, Tepco as plant operator was liable for damages irrespective of whether there had been been negligence. A statement issued by the plaintiffs ' legal team declared that the judges had thus given higher weight to an industry internal forecasting method over the government's own long-term authoritative evaluation. The lawyers cited testimony in the trial from an expert witness that the JSCE study had not specifically considered whether tsunami could occur offshore Fukushima. The Tokyo High Court rationale appeared to parallel that of the Tokyo District Court in the Tepco criminal case. In the latter, the court said that a finding of professional negligence must be `` beyond a reasonable doubt '' of `` predictability in the events '' leading to deaths or injuries. Further, the district court said that the Headquarters ' forecasts warning of severe earthquakes or tsunami were irrelevant since \\u201c accurate prediction or foresight is not possible so long as natural phenomenon are involved. '' A spokesperson for the Tokyo-based National Network of Counsels in Cases against Nuclear Power Plants expressed concern that these findings could `` have a negative impact on the appeal of the Tepco criminal responsibility trial which is being held by the same court \\u201d ( NIW Oct.4'19). In September 2019 the Tokyo District Court found three former top Tepco executives \\u201c not guilty \\u201d of charges of professional negligence resulting in death ( NIW Sep.20'19). The Sendai High Court, citing the government agency's earthquake predictions, held that the government shares responsibility for redress equally with Tepco because it acted \\u201c illegally \\u201d in failing to enforce its regulatory authority and ordering Tepco to take proper preventative measures. Notably, the judges found JSEC's tsunami assessment model \\u201c unsuitable \\u201d given the organization's close ties with the power industry. Similarly, the Maebashi District Court judges had ordered government compensation, saying that the triple meltdown could have been prevented if the government had ordered Tepco to adopt safety measures such as installing emergency generators on top of plant buildings instead of the reactor building basements. Setting the Stage for a Supreme Court Challenge Given that the Sendai High Court ruling is under appeal by all parties, and that plaintiffs in the Jan. 21 ruling also plan an appeal, the stage may be set for Japan's Supreme Court to rule on the matter. This leaves prospects for a ruling favorable to Fukushima victims, at best, uncertain. \\u201c The Supreme Court is still very conservative, \\u201d observed Citizens Nuclear Information Center Secretary-General Hajime Matsukubo. Tepco itself can take little comfort from the latest high court ruling as it continued a streak of court findings that the utility, as plant operator, bore liability for damages. Moreover, in the Tokyo High Court ruling, the court raised total compensation to just short of 120 million yen for 90 of 91 plaintiffs compared to about 38 million yen for 62 plaintiffs in the Maebashi District Court. Meanwhile, Japanese legal experts have their eyes on three upcoming court decisions which could influence the direction of both compensation and restart cases in the future. An appeal of a 2017 Chiba District Court decision against government liability for Fukushima will be heard by a separate panel of three Tokyo High Court judges on Feb. 19. The lower court ordered Tepco to pay 376 million yen in compensation to most of the 45 plaintiffs, who sought 2.8 billion yen in redress, but rejected demands for compensation by the national government, according to the Mainichi Shimbun. Two court cases on reactor restarts are imminent. The Japan Atomic Power Co. expects a verdict from the Mito District Court Mar. 18 on its plans to restart its Tokai-2 BWR after residents filed for an injunction against the restart in July 2012. By coincidence, Shikoku Electric's hopes to restart its Ikata-3 PWR, idled since late December 2019, require a favorable verdict on the same day by the Hiroshima High Court which issued a preliminary injunction against the unit's operation last January ( NIW Jan.24'20).

The company\\u2019 s large-scale hydrogen partnerships include what it touted as the largest green energy storage project and the largest blue hydrogen project in North America in announcing a partnership with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Mitsubishi Power has retained Citi \\u201c to explore growth financing options \\u201d for the massive buildout. Hydrogen is seen as a key element of the energy transition because of its versatility as an emissions-free fuel at the point of combustion, and as a vessel of energy that may be converted to electricity when fed through a fuel cell. The challenge lies in scaling up production of low-carbon \\u201c green \\u201d and \\u201c blue \\u201d hydrogen. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting hydrogen molecules from water via electrolysis powered by renewable or nuclear energy. Blue hydrogen production entails splitting hydrogen from natural gas and then capturing and storing the carbon dioxide emissions. Mitsubishi Power\\u2019 s flagship green energy storage project, Advanced Clean Energy Storage, is a partnership with Magnum Development LLC in Delta, UT. The companies plan \\u201c to create a green hydrogen hub that will eventually provide pipeline connectivity throughout the Western Interconnect of North America, \\u201d Mitsubishi Power said. \\u201c The project will produce renewable hydrogen, store it in vast underground salt dome caverns, and dispatch it as a clean fuel for power generation, transportation and industrial applications. \\u201d The blue hydrogen project, meanwhile, is a joint venture with Bakken Energy in North Dakota. It comprises facilities that will produce, store, transport and consume blue hydrogen. A partnership with Texas Brine Co. LLC, meanwhile, \\u201c provides salt dome rights that position Mitsubishi Power to develop green or blue hydrogen hubs in New York, Virginia, Louisiana and Texas, \\u201d Mitsubishi Power said. Mitsubishi Power \\u201c also will use Citi for guidance as it extends its web of joint development projects and partnerships with hydrogen offtakers. \\u201d \\u201c Mitsubishi Power has already secured several joint development agreements ( JDA), gas turbine orders for power projects with hydrogen capabilities, and offtaker agreements. \\u201d Partnerships include JDAs to help utilities Gulf Coast utility Entergy Corp. and the Pacific Northwest\\u2019 s Puget Sound Energy decarbonize their operations Mitsubishi Power also is manufacturing hydrogen gas turbines for Intermountain Power Agency in Utah and for Capital Power in Alberta. Citi Vice Chairman Stephen Trauber said, \\u201c Mitsubishi Power has\\u2026a clear vision to connect the continent to decarbonize the power generation, transportation and industrial sectors\\u2026We will leverage our expertise in assisting clients in traditionally carbon-intensive industries to help Mitsubishi Power explore their options to attract and deploy capital from investment partners. \\u201d Browning added, \\u201c For several years, we\\u2019 ve been working with early adopters of green and blue hydrogen that have advantaged access to existing hydrogen infrastructure, such as the Intermountain Power Agency, Magnum Development, Bakken Energy, and Entergy\\u2019 s Orange County Advanced Clean Power Station. Now we plan to build off of these early adopter projects to build a hydrogen hub-and-spoke infrastructure that spans North America and Makes clean, affordable hydrogen widely available. \\u201d A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative found that a hydrogen-fired gas turbines ( HGFT) can compete in terms of levelized cost of electricity with lithium-ion batteries in offsetting the seasonal variability of wind and solar plants. \\u201c However, we find the power prices required to justify investment in an HFGT to replace a natural gas-fired turbine are considerably higher than those seen in the market today, \\u201d researchers said. On Tuesday, meanwhile, researchers at Pusan National University in South Korea said they developed a method for producing green hydrogen in a more efficient, less energy-intensive manner that could allow production to scale up more rapidly. \\u00a9 2021 Natural Gas Intelligence.

For this interview, we spoke to Dr. Adina Rom, the Executive Director of ETH for Development.\",\n          \"Danish utility Orsted intends to spend over $ 57 billion on renewables and low-carbon technologies by the end of 2027 in a bid to establish itself as a `` global green energy major. '' But the ambitious target, revealed last week, still lags that of a number of its European utility peers, as well as oil and gas companies positioning themselves for the energy transition ( WGI Nov.18'20). Orsted is now eyeing 50 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity by 2030. That is roughly in line with BP, which has set a `` net developed '' renewable capacity target of 20 GW by 2025 and 50 GW by 2030. But it's less than TotalEnergies, which is targeting 35 GW by 2025 and 100 GW by 2030, or other European utilities such as Spain's Iberdrola and Italy's Enel. Iberdrola says it will spend \\u20ac150 billion ( $ 183 billion) on having 95 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030 ( WGI Mar.3'21). Enel wants 145 GW operational by that date. Orsted became a pure renewables player in 2017 after selling its oil and gas business. It has become a world leader in offshore wind, betting heavily on the technology over the past decade when some of its peers dismissed it as too expensive. Its new plan increases by 50% the expenditure pledge made at Orsted's last capital markets day in 2018 and quadruples existing renewables capacity of 12 GW. Playing to its strengths, the company will devote the lion's share of spending to offshore wind. It plans to add 22.5 GW to existing operational capacity of 7.5 GW. It has 17.3 GW of firm capacity in the pipeline, either under construction or in late-stage development, and must progress a further 12.7 GW. Growth markets include the US, the Baltic states, the Nordic region and Asia. With 68 GW in potential projects, there are plenty of options on the table. The company says the growing offshore wind market will allow it to be `` selective, '' and that `` early moves enable Orsted to leverage its development expertise and avoid excessive premiums as markets/projects mature '' ( WGI Feb.24'21). Orsted expects offshore wind to be the fastest-growing renewable technology over the next decade. It puts annual growth at roughly 20%, and sees installed capacity jumping from 24 GW in 2020 to more than 170 GW in 2030. The EU expects 60 GW to be built by 2030, while the US has a nonbinding target of 30 GW. Still, the International Energy Agency says the pace of growth remains below levels needed to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury. In addition, the company intends to expand in onshore wind and solar photovoltaics to become a `` top 10 '' global onshore renewables player, with 17.5 GW of operational capacity by 2030. The US, Europe and Asia are all seen as growth markets. Some 4.7 GW of mainly onshore wind and solar PV capacity is operational, and roughly 10 GW is `` substantiated, '' leaving 2 GW-3 GW of projects to be found. It wants to split the capacity 50-50, versus 70% onshore wind now, reflecting customer preferences for solar-based corporate power purchase agreements. Orsted also wants to become a global leader in green fuels and green hydrogen -- produced from renewables -- to displace fossil fuel-based hydrogen in refineries and ammonia production, and for use in new areas like steel and heavy transport. It has more than 3 GW of electrolyzer capacity in the pipeline ( WGI Jun.17'20). Projects have been proposed in Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the UK, some linked to huge offshore wind farms. But it warns that `` regulatory mandates or incentives for green fuels '' will be required to unlock renewable hydrogen and green fuels projects in Europe, and a customer base must be built up ( WGI Oct.7'20).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

An ongoing water crisis in the West has seven states struggling to agree on how to divide water from the Colorado River, leaving the federal government to forge a plan that will likely lead to litigation. Meanwhile, scientists are forecasting all-time low levels in the nation's largest water reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, and a recent report warns that Utah's Great Salt Lake is `` on track to disappear in five years. '' Warming temperatures help set the stage for continued water decline, but much of the West's water future hinges on the future of precipitation -; a factor researchers are still trying to better understand, according to climate scientist Flavio Lehner, who has monitored water supply in the Southwest for about a decade. Lehner says: '' Warmer temperatures decrease the portion of precipitation that ends up in the Colorado River and in the reservoirs. So even if precipitation remains constant, we expect a decline in available water. That's why there is little hope for things to return to 'normal ' this century - we're seemingly locked into a drier future. Unfortunately, over the past 40 years, we 've also seen a decline in precipitation over this region, making things bad much quicker. `` Therefore, despite the clear influence of warming, the real elephant in the room is precipitation. Warming alone typically does not cause a drought. It can make a drought worse, yes, but it typically starts with a precipitation deficit. While warming is guaranteed to continue with further greenhouse gas emissions, we don't know yet what's going to happen to precipitation. `` If precipitation continues to decline in the Southwestern U.S., things will get worse quickly. If it rebounds, we might get a short breather to figure out a sustainable way to manage the Colorado River. Research into what will happen to precipitation is thus critical - it's the missing puzzle piece to the water future of the Southwest.

In this interview, AZoCleantech speaks with Tebogo Maleka, National Project Coordinator at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO), about her role within the organization and the initiative that aims to support South Africa's transition from conventional plastics to more environmentally sustainable alternatives. AZoCleantech recently spoke to entrepreneur Si\\u00e2n Sutherland, the Co-Founder of A Plastic Planet, for International Women's Day. Her company's goal is to inspire the world to turn off the plastic tap to help reduce its burden on the planet.

Rendering of a 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV RST in a residential garage with anticipated Ultium Home offerings. Simulated products shown. Actual production model may vary. Simulated vehicle shown. Actual production model may vary. \\u201c As GM Energy\\u2019 s ecosystem of connected products and services continues to expand, we\\u2019 re excited to provide customers with options for greater energy management beyond the vehicle, \\u201d said Wade Sheffer, vice president, GM Energy. \\u201c Our initial Ultium Home offerings represent an opportunity for customers to take greater control over their personal energy independence and resiliency. \\u201d The initial suite of Ultium Home products will be offered through bundle options, providing customers with the ability to select solutions that align with their energy needs and budget. Ultium Home V2H Bundle \\u2013 designed for customers seeking to leverage their compatible GM EVs for vehicle-to-home ( V2H) functionality. Ultium Home Energy System \\u2013 designed for customers seeking to leverage their compatible GM EV for V2H functionality and stationary storage. Ultium Home Energy Storage Bundle \\u2013 designed for customers seeking to integrate stationary storage into their home, without the need for an EV. Solar integration \\u2013 In addition to the initial suite of Ultium Home products, customers seeking to integrate solar energy will have the opportunity to work with SunPower, GM Energy\\u2019 s exclusive solar provider, and a preferred EV charger installer to deliver power to their home and vehicle with solar installed on their roof. Each of these Ultium Home products will be connected to the GM Energy Cloud, a software platform which will allow customers to seamlessly manage the transfer of energy between applicable and connected GM Energy assets. MSRP and timeline for delivery for each of Ultium Home\\u2019 s initial product bundles will vary. Kelly Pickerel has over a decade of experience reporting on the U.S. solar industry and is currently editor in chief of Solar Power World. Looks like V2H uses Sunrun systems for Ford and now GM seems to be using SunPower for their V2H option. Roughly ( IF) a home\\u2019 s service panel can handle another 100Amp C.B. for the charger/resiliency system, then about another $ 5K to $ 6K to have the Sunrun or SunPower system installed. Early solar PV adopters, seem to be running into a \\u201c Rube Goldberg \\u201d V2H solution. The question is ( when), does the interfacing of \\u201c systems \\u201d make it totally unattractive to homeowners. Copyright \\u00a9 2023 WTWH Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

The Auxiliary Sail Propulsion System (ASPS) is a concept that combines fixed wing sail technology with the rotation of masts to harness wind power for propulsion. The system consists of a main sail, a rotating mast, and a propulsion system.\\n\\nThe fixed wing sail is positioned on the main sail and is designed to capture wind energy and convert it into propulsive force. The rotating mast is connected to the main sail and is used to rotate the sail in response to wind direction and speed.\\n\\nAs the wind blows, it causes the main sail to rotate around the mast. This rotation generates lift and drag forces that propel the vessel forward. The propulsion system, which can include a propeller or other mechanisms, is used to convert the rotational energy generated by the sail into forward thrust.\\n\\nThe ASPS is an innovative approach to harnessing wind power for propulsion, combining the benefits of fixed wing sails with the flexibility and adaptability of rotating masts. By utilizing this technology, vessels can achieve greater efficiency and reduced fuel consumption, making it an attractive option for sustainable maritime transportation.\",\n          \"What components make up the emergency power supply function of the FTU? The emergency power supply function of the FTU comprises the following components:\\n\\n1. The emergency power supply is connected to the FTU through a power supply cable.\\n2. The FTU is equipped with a power supply module, which is responsible for converting the emergency power supply into usable power for the FTU.\\n3. The FTU also includes a power management module, which regulates and distributes the power generated by the power supply module.\\n4. The FTU is further equipped with a power storage module, which stores excess power generated by the power supply module for later use.\\n5. The FTU is connected to the power grid through a power grid connection module, allowing it to draw power from the grid when necessary.\\n6. The FTU is also equipped with a power monitoring module, which monitors the power consumption and generation of the FTU.\\n7. The FTU includes a power protection module, which safeguards the FTU from power fluctuations and ensures a stable power supply.\\n8.

The system consists of a main sail, a rotating mast, and a propulsion system.\\n\\nThe fixed wing sail is positioned on the main sail and is designed to capture wind energy and convert it into propulsive force. The rotating mast is connected to the main sail and is used to rotate the sail in response to wind direction and speed.\\n\\nAs the wind blows, it causes the main sail to rotate around the mast. This rotation generates lift and drag forces that propel the vessel forward. The propulsion system, which can include a propeller or other mechanisms, is used to convert the rotational energy generated by the sail into forward thrust.\\n\\nThe ASPS is an innovative approach to harnessing wind power for propulsion, combining the benefits of fixed wing sails with the flexibility and adaptability of rotating masts. By utilizing this technology, vessels can achieve greater efficiency and reduced fuel consumption, making it an attractive option for sustainable maritime transportation.\",\n          \"The emergency power supply function of the FTU comprises the following components:\\n\\n1.

The system consists of a main sail, a rotating mast, and a propulsion system.\\n\\nThe fixed wing sail is positioned on the main sail and is designed to capture wind energy and convert it into propulsive force. The rotating mast is connected to the main sail and is used to rotate the sail in response to wind direction and speed.\\n\\nAs the wind blows, it causes the main sail to rotate around the mast. This rotation generates lift and drag forces that propel the vessel forward. The propulsion system, which can include a propeller or other mechanisms, is used to convert the rotational energy generated by the sail into forward thrust.\\n\\nThe ASPS is an innovative approach to harnessing wind power for propulsion, combining the benefits of fixed wing sails with the flexibility and adaptability of rotating masts. By utilizing this technology, vessels can achieve greater efficiency and reduced fuel consumption, making it an attractive option for sustainable maritime transportation.\",\n          \"The emergency power supply function of the FTU comprises the following components:\\n\\n1.
